# hiero-solo-action

A GitHub Action for setting up a Hiero Solo network.
An overview of the usage and idea of the action can be found [here](https://dev.to/hendrikebbers/ci-for-hedera-based-projects-2nja).

The network that is created by the action contains one consensus node that can be accessed at `localhost:50211`.
Optionally, you can deploy a second consensus node by enabling `dualMode: true`. When dual mode is enabled, the second node is accessible at `localhost:51211`.
You can optionally provision a block node by enabling `installBlockNode: true`. The action reuses `hieroVersion` as the Solo block node `--release-tag`.
When a mirror node is installed, the Java-based REST API can be accessed at `localhost:8084`.
The action creates an account on the network that contains 10,000,000 hbars.
All information about the account is stored as output to the github action.

A good example on how the action is used can be found at the [hiero-enterprise project action](<[https://github.com/OpenElements/hedera-enterprise/blob/main/.github/workflows/maven.yml](https://github.com/OpenElements/hiero-enterprise-java/blob/main/.github/workflows/maven.yml)>). Here the action is used to create a temporary network that is than used to execute tests against the network.

## Inputs

The GitHub action takes the following inputs:

| Input                    | Required | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `hbarAmount`             | false    | `10000000` | Amount of hbars to fund a created account with.                                                                                            |
| `hieroVersion`           | false    | `v0.72.0`  | Hiero consensus node version to use. When `installBlockNode` is enabled, this same value is passed to Solo as the block node release tag. |
| `installBlockNode`       | false    | `false`    | If set to `true`, the action provisions a block node before consensus node deployment. No separate block-node version input is exposed.    |
| `mirrorNodeVersion`      | false    | `v0.151.0` | Mirror node version to use                                                                                                                 |
| `installMirrorNode`      | false    | `false`    | If set to `true`, the action will install a mirror node in addition to the main node. The mirror node can be accessed at `localhost:5551`. |

> [! IMPORTANT]
> The default `soloVersion` and `hieroVersion` are kept aligned in this repository.
> If you override `hieroVersion`, make sure the selected Solo CLI version supports that Hiero release.
> When `installBlockNode` is enabled, the same `hieroVersion` value is also used for `solo block node add --release-tag`.

# Simple usage

```yaml
- name: Setup Hiero Solo
  uses: hiero-ledger/hiero-solo-action@v0.8
  id: solo

- name: Use Hiero Solo
  run: |
    echo "Account ID: ${{ steps.solo.outputs.accountId }}"
    echo "Private Key: ${{ steps.solo.outputs.privateKey }}"
    echo "Public Key: ${{ steps.solo.outputs.publicKey }}"
```

# Usage with `ecdsa` account format

```yaml
- name: Setup Hiero Solo
  uses: hiero-ledger/hiero-solo-action@v0.8
  id: solo

- name: Use Hiero Solo
  run: |
    echo "Account ID: ${{ steps.solo.outputs.ecdsaAccountId }}"
    echo "Private Key: ${{ steps.solo.outputs.ecdsaPrivateKey }}"
    echo "Public Key: ${{ steps.solo.outputs.ecdsaPublicKey }}"
```

# Usage with `ED25519` account format

```yaml
- name: Setup Hiero Solo
  uses: hiero-ledger/hiero-solo-action@v0.8
  id: solo

- name: Use Hiero Solo
  run: |
    echo "Account ID: ${{ steps.solo.outputs.ed25519AccountId }}"
    echo "Private Key: ${{ steps.solo.outputs.ed25519PrivateKey }}"
    echo "Public Key: ${{ steps.solo.outputs.ed25519PublicKey }}"
```

# Usage with `hbarAmount`

```yaml
- name: Setup Hiero Solo
  uses: hiero-ledger/hiero-solo-action@v0.8
  id: solo
  with:
    hbarAmount: 10000000

- name: Use Hiero Solo
  run: |
    echo "Account ID: ${{ steps.solo.outputs.accountId }}"
    # Display account information including the current amount of HBAR
    solo account get --account-id ${{ steps.solo.outputs.accountId }} --deployment "solo-deployment"
```

# Usage with Block Node

Use `installBlockNode: true` to provision a block node. The action reuses the existing `hieroVersion` input for the block node release tag, so no additional block-node version input is needed.

```yaml
- name: Setup Hiero Solo with Block Node
  uses: hiero-ledger/hiero-solo-action@v0.8
  id: solo
  with:
    hieroVersion: v0.73.0
    installBlockNode: true
```

# Usage with Dual Mode (2 Consensus Nodes)

```yaml
- name: Setup Hiero Solo with Dual Mode
  uses: hiero-ledger/hiero-solo-action@v0.8
  id: solo
  with:
    dualMode: true

- name: Verify Nodes
  run: |
    echo "Checking services for both nodes..."
    kubectl get svc -n solo
    kubectl get pods -n solo
    echo "Node 1 is accessible at localhost:50211"
    echo "Node 2 is accessible at localhost:51211"
    echo "Account ID: ${{ steps.solo.outputs.accountId }}"
```

# Local Solo Test Network

The [README.md](./local/README.md) describes how to set up a local solo test network only with Docker.

# Tributes

This action is based on the work of [Hiero Solo](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/solo).
Without the great help of [Timo](https://github.com/timo0), [Nathan](https://github.com/nathanklick), and [Lenin](https://github.com/leninmehedy) this action would not exist.
